# Web Application Test Planning Guidelines

## Test Scenario Design Principles

1. **User Flow Exploration**
   - Map out primary user journeys
   - Consider different user types and behaviors
   - Identify all interactive elements and navigation paths

2. **Scenario Coverage**
   - Include scenarios for:
     * Happy path (normal user behavior)
     * Edge cases and boundary conditions
     * Error handling and validation

3. **Scenario Structure**
   Each test scenario must include:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Expected outcomes
   - Starting state assumptions
   - Success criteria and failure conditions

4. **Quality Standards**
   - Write steps that are specific and reproducible
   - Ensure scenarios are:
     * Independent
     * Can be run in any order
   - Include negative testing scenarios

5. **Documentation Format**
   - Use markdown for test plans
   - Include:
     * Executive summary of application
     * Individual scenarios as separate sections
     * Numbered steps
     * Clear verification criteria

## Example Test Scenario Template

```markdown
### Scenario Title

**Preconditions:**
- List any required setup or initial state

**Steps:**
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Expected Results:**
- Result one
- Result two

**Failure Conditions:**
- List potential failure scenarios
```

## Best Practices
- Always start with a fresh/blank state
- Minimize unnecessary screenshots
- Focus on thorough interface exploration
- Prioritize user experience and functionality testing
