//await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle") it can nicely wait for network provided by utility playwright

also you can make the multiple browser context and run them at once

=== Playwright Agents Overview (September 12, 2025) ===

=== Playwright MCP Accessibility Snapshots (September 12, 2025) ===

Playwright MCP uses accessibility snapshots as a key feature for web automation. Here's how it works:

1. Snapshot Creation:
   - Instead of using pixel-based visual analysis
   - Creates a structured representation of the page through the accessibility tree
   - Provides clean, structured data that LLMs can easily understand and process

2. Key Benefits:
   - Fast & Lightweight: No need for heavy vision models or image processing
   - Reliable: Uses semantic structure rather than visual appearance
   - Deterministic: Based on page structure, not visual positions
   - LLM-Friendly: Provides data in a format that AI can easily parse

3. How It Works:
   - browser_snapshot tool captures the page state
   - Represents elements with their roles, names, and relationships
   - Creates a hierarchical structure similar to what screen readers use
   - Includes interactive properties (clickable, editable, etc.)

4. Advantages Over Traditional Automation:
   - More stable than pixel-based or coordinate-based automation
   - Better handling of dynamic content
   - More accessible and semantic approach to web interaction
   - Closer to how humans understand web pages

5. Practical Usage:
   - AI can understand page structure and content
   - Can locate elements by their semantic meaning
   - Makes decisions based on accessibility tree rather than visual layout
   - More robust automation across different screen sizes and layouts

This approach makes web automation more reliable and maintainable while being more efficient than traditional visual-based approaches.

Playwright Agents is a powerful automation solution that combines AI with browser automation. Here's a comprehensive overview:

1. What is Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
- It's a communication standard that allows AI agents to control web browsers
- Built on top of Playwright's core technology
- Uses accessibility snapshots instead of pixel-based interaction
- Provides a structured, reliable way for AI to interact with web pages

2. Key Advantages:
- Fast & Lightweight: No need for heavy vision models
- Reliable: Uses element roles and names instead of positions
- LLM-Friendly: Provides clean, structured data
- Natural Language Control: Accept plain English commands

3. Main Use Cases:

For Development:
- Automated test generation
- Website exploration and test case discovery
- Interactive debugging assistance

For Automation:
- Form filling and data entry
- Multi-step process automation
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Dashboard monitoring

4. How It Works:
- MCP Client: Your interface (e.g., VS Code with GitHub Copilot)
- MCP Server: The "hands" that execute commands
- AI Agent: Translates natural language to browser actions

5. Getting Started:
- Install via VS Code extension
- Uses @playwright/mcp package
- Simple JSON configuration
- Immediate browser control through natural language

Example Usage Scenarios:
- "Fill out this contact form with our company details"
- "Check GitHub issues for critical bugs"
- "Generate tests for shopping cart checkout"
- "Extract data from multiple web pages"


DO EFFECTICE SELECTOR RETRIES

This technology bridges the gap between natural language instructions and automated browser interactions, making web automation more accessible and maintainable.

Basic Multiple Contexts Example: -  multiContext.spec.js

The first test shows how to create two separate browser contexts (adminContext and userContext)
Each context gets its own page object
The contexts operate independently, simulating different user sessions
Perfect for testing multi-user scenarios
Contexts with Different Storage States:

The second test demonstrates how to create contexts with different storage states
Each context can have its own:
Cookies
localStorage
sessionStorage
Other browser storage mechanisms
Key Benefits of Multiple Contexts:

Isolation: Each context is completely isolated from others
Independent Sessions: Perfect for testing multi-user scenarios
Different Configurations: Each context can have different:
Storage states
Permissions
Geolocation
Color schemes
Viewport sizes
To run this specific test, you can use:
